# licensing-library-junit-tests1

This repository is dedicated solely to JUNIT tests, providing a comprehensive suite of tests that cover a wide range of license validation tasks. It serves as a valuable resource for developers and testers alike, enabling them to explore the functionality and robustness of various [licensing models and features](https://www.license4j.com/features/).

Within this collection, you will find numerous test cases that not only validate the correctness of license implementations but also showcase different licensing scenarios, helping you to understand how each model operates in practice. You can leverage these tests to evaluate features, experiment with configurations, and gather insights into effective licensing strategies.
